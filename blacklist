#Ubuntu has added a suggested package which installs a config file for network manager.
#This config file enables a feature which checks the connection is actually connected
#to the internet. It does this by connecting to a website on the internet every five
#minutes. Due to privacy concerns, Lubuntu is NOT installing this package by default,
#leaving it to the user to decide if he/she wants this feature.
