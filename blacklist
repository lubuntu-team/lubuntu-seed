# Ubuntu has added a suggested package which installs a config file for network manager.
# This config file enables a feature which checks the connection is actually connected
# to the internet. It does this by connecting to a website on the internet every five
# minutes. Due to privacy concerns, Lubuntu is NOT installing this package by default,
# leaving it to the user to decide if he/she wants this feature.

# snapd automatically uses a bit of RAM, and Lubuntu doesn't plan on ever installing
# Snaps by default, so let's not even put it on the ISO, people can install it if they
# want it...
